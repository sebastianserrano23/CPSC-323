Write a program to find the value of a postfix expression. Variables are one or more
characters each. We might have some integer numbers as part of the expression.(Hint. Read each part of
the expression as a token of type string, if the first character of the token is a letter that indicates the
token is a variable name, push its value in stack. If the token is an integer number use the predefined
function stoi (member of <string> library) to return its numeric value of the token.
